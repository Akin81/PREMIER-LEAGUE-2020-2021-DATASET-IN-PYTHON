# PREMIER-LEAGUE-2020-2021-DATASET


INTRODUCTION



I obtained the 2020/2021 dataset from Kaggle.com and imported it into my notebook using the pandas library. I conducted a comprehensive assessment of the dataset, including checking its shape, description, and null values, to extract valuable information for meaningful insights.




During my analysis, I observed that there were no null values in the dataset. I then proceeded to visualize the data using the matplotlib and seaborn libraries.




My analysis revealed several important insights, including:

Approximately 35% of productive Premier League players are between the ages of 20 and 30 years old. Therefore, clubs should exercise caution when signing players who are above 30 years old.

Manchester City had the highest total number of assists and goals in the Premier League in the 2020/2021 season. This indicates that they had the strongest attackers in the league during that season.

Harry Kane had the highest total number of assists per match.

Goals with assists accounted for 69% of the total goals scored, indicating that clubs should understand that strikers alone cannot win matches. The contributions of other positions, such as midfielders and wingers, are equally important.
